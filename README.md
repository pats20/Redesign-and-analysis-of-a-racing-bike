# Redesign-and-analysis-of-a-racing-bike



## Project Description
•	Designed and modelled a racing bike using a CAD tool in SolidWorks<br/>
•	Modelled and assembled each part of the bicycle and simulated using motion analysis<br/>
•	Performed stress and strain analysis and drop test using SolidWorks simulation tool on the frame and front shock absorber of the bike to check strength,  	 stiffness and structural stability<br/>
